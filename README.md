Bitreserve is a next generation money service business that shields you from bitcoin volatility by enabling you to hold bitcoin as the money you use every day.

The Bitreserve SDK for PHP provides an easy way for developers to integrate PHP applications with the [Bitreserve API](https://developers.bitreserve.org).

## Requirements

* PHP >= 5.4.4 with the [cURL](http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php) extension.
* [Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) library.

## Installation

### Standalone

Grab the latest version of the library:

    $ git clone https://github.com/seegno/bitreserve-sdk-php.git

Install composer:

    $ curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Install the library dependencies:

    $ php composer.phar install

Require the autoloader file generated by composer:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

### Integrating with another project using composer

Require the library package as a dependency:
```json
{
    "require": {
        "seegno/bitreserve-sdk-php": "1.0.*"
    }
}
```

## Basic usage:

In order to create a Personal Access Token (PAT) and learn more about the Bitreserve API, please check out the [developer website](https://developer.bitreserve.org/api/v0/#authentication).

Then, create a new instance of the `Client` class with token. Take a look at the following examples and explore more on the [examples](https://github.com/bitreserve/bitreserve-sdk-php/tree/master/examples) directory.

### Get authenticated user
```php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

use \Bitreserve\BitreserveClient as Client;

// Initialize the client.
$client = new Client('AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN');

// Get the current user.
$user = $client->getUser();
```

### Create and commit a new transaction
```php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

use \Bitreserve\BitreserveClient as Client;

// Initialize the client.
$client = new Client('AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN');

// Get the current user.
$user = $client->getUser();

// Get a specific card by id.
$card = $user->getCardsById('ade869d8-7913-4f67-bb4d-72719f0a2be0');

// Create a new transaction.
$transaction = $card->createTransaction('foo@bar.com', '2.0', 'BTC');

// Commit the transaction.
$transaction->commit();
```
